# 📘 Dive into Deep Learning – My Learning Journey

This repository documents my personal journey through the [Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/) book. I'm working through the chapters using **PyTorch**, implementing core deep learning models from scratch, experimenting with the concepts, and probably extending them into small side projects.

My goal is to build a strong, intuitive, and hands-on understanding of modern deep learning – from basics to advanced models – as part of my master's degree in computer science with a focus on machine learning and data science.

## 📚 What's Inside

### ✅ Chapters and Exercises

Each chapter folder contains:

- one notebook per subchapter where I code along and work on the exercises
- a readme with the contents of the chapter and subchapters

### 🛠️ Projects

Experiments or fun side projects that go beyond the book; currently none might add later, e.g.:

- `cnn_fashion_classifier/`: A CNN trained on FashionMNIST
- `bandname_generator/`: An RNN that invents indie band names 🎸
- using RL to train a model to play 3D Pinball Space Cadet

## 💡 Why I'm Doing This

I want to:

- Deeply understand the math and mechanics of deep learning.
- Strengthen my PyTorch, Python and project structuring skills.
- Build a solid foundation before diving further into NLP and LLMs (e.g. via the [Hugging Face Course on LLMs](https://huggingface.co/course)).

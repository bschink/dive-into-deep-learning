# 📘 Dive into Deep Learning – My Learning Journey

This repository documents my personal journey through the excellent [Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/) book. I'm working through the chapters using **PyTorch**, implementing core deep learning models from scratch, experimenting with the concepts, and extending them into small side projects.

My goal is to build a strong, intuitive, and hands-on understanding of modern deep learning – from basics to advanced models – as part of my master's degree in computer science with a focus on machine learning and data science.

## 📚 What's Inside

### ✅ Chapters and Exercises
Each chapter folder contains:
- 📓 **My notes** (insights, reflections, and key takeaways)
- 🧠 **Implementations** (from-scratch and PyTorch-based)
- 🧪 **Experiments** (tweaks, visualizations, tests)

| Chapter | Topic | Status |
|--------|-----------------------------|--------|
| `02`   | Linear Regression           | ✅ Done |
| `03`   | Softmax Classification      | ✅ Done |
| `04`   | Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) | ✅ Done |
| `06`   | Optimization Algorithms     | 🛠 In Progress |
| `07`   | Regularization & Overfitting| 🔜 Planned |
| ...    | ...                         | ...    |

### 🛠️ Projects
Experiments or fun side projects that go beyond the book, e.g.:
- `cnn_fashion_classifier/`: A CNN trained on FashionMNIST
- `bandname_generator/`: An RNN that invents indie band names 🎸

## 💡 Why I'm Doing This

I want to:
- Deeply understand the math and mechanics of deep learning.
- Strengthen my PyTorch and project structuring skills.
- Build a solid foundation before diving further into NLP and LLMs (e.g. via the [Hugging Face Course](https://huggingface.co/course)).

# üìò Chapter 08 ‚Äì Modern Convolutional Neural Networks

In this chapter, I explored the evolution of modern convolutional neural network architectures. Starting with AlexNet, I learned how depth and GPU acceleration marked a turning point in deep learning. I then studied VGG, NiN, and GoogLeNet, each introducing architectural innovations like blocks, 1x1 convolutions, and inception modules. The chapter continued with powerful advancements such as batch normalization, residual connections (ResNet & ResNeXt), and dense connectivity in DenseNet. Finally, I learned how to approach network design systematically using the AnyNet design space, exemplified by RegNet.

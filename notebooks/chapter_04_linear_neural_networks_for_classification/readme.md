# üìò Chapter 04 ‚Äì Linear Neural Networks for Classification

In this chapter, I explored how to extend linear models to classification tasks using softmax regression. I learned about the softmax function, cross-entropy loss, and core ideas from information theory. The chapter introduced the FashionMNIST dataset as a benchmark for image classification and guided the implementation of softmax regression both from scratch and using PyTorch‚Äôs high-level APIs. I also created a reusable base classifier class to streamline future model development. The final sections discussed theoretical aspects of generalization in classification and examined challenges like distribution shift, providing a taxonomy of learning problems. There are no notebooks for 4.6 and 4.7 because there was nothing to code there.

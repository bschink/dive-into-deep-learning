## 📌 Topics Covered by Subchapter

### 5.1. Multilayer Perceptrons

Building Multilayer Perceptrons by introducing hidden layers and adding more capabilities than with a single layer by introducing nonlinear activation functions (ReLu, sigmoid, tanh).

### 5.2. Implementation of Multilayer Perceptrons

Implementation of MLP with one hidden layer both from scratch and using high level Pytorch functions

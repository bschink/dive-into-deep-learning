# üìò Chapter 07 ‚Äì Convolutional Neural Networks

In this chapter, I was introduced to the core concepts behind convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and how they differ from fully connected networks. I learned how convolutions operate on image data using kernels, and how techniques like padding and stride affect the output. The chapter also covered the use of multiple input and output channels, as well as pooling layers to reduce spatial dimensions. Finally, I combined these components to implement LeNet, one of the earliest convolutional neural network architectures No notebook for 7.1 because there was nothing to code.

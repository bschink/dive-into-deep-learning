## üìå Topics Covered by Subchapter

### 3.1. Linear Regression

Revised the concepts of model, loss function, optimization via SGD and linear regression.

### 3.2. Object-Oriented Design for Implementation

Introduced an object-oriented structure for the further implementation of models using three base classes (Module, DataModule, Trainer).

### 3.3. Synthetic Regression Data

To confirm that the implementation of a particular learning algorithm works as expected it can be helpful to test it with synthetic data. Therefore this chapter shows how to implement a synthetic data generator for linear regression and how to read and load the generated data.

### 3.4 Linear Regression Implementation from Scratch

Implementing linear regression (model, loss function, optimization algorithm) from scratch only using Pytorch for tensors and automatic differentiation for computing gradients.

### 3.5 Concise Implementation of Linear Regression

Implementing linear regression using all the features Pytorch offers like Lazy Linear, MSELoss and SGD.

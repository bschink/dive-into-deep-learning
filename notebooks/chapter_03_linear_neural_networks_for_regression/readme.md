## 📌 Topics Covered by Subchapter

### 3.1. Linear Regression

Revised the concepts of model, loss function, optimization via SGD and linear regression.

### 3.2. Object-Oriented Design for Implementation

Introduced an object-oriented structure for the further implementation of models using three base classes (Module, DataModule, Trainer).

### 3.3. Synthetic Regression Data

To confirm that the implementation of a particular learning algorithm works as expected it can be helpful to test it with synthetic data. Therefore this chapter shows how to implement a synthetic data generator for linear regression and how to read and load the generated data.

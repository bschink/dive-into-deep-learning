## 📌 Topics Covered by Subchapter

### 2.1 Data Manipulation

Learned basic tensor operations using PyTorch’s `torch.tensor` and `torch.arange`. This included indexing, slicing, broadcasting, saving memory through in place operations and conversions of tensors to other Python objects.

### 2.2 Data Preprocessing

Explored data loading with pandas, data preperation and conversion to the tensor format.

### 2.3 Linear Algebra

Revised linear algebra basics and their Pytorch implementations. This included scalars, vectors, matrices, tensors, reduction, dot product and matrix multiplication.

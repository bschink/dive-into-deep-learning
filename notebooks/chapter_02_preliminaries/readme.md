# 📘 Chapter 02 – Preliminaries

<!--TODO: write text-->
<!-- This chapter covers essential mathematical and programming foundations needed for deep learning. I implemented the concepts in separate notebooks, each focusing on one topic.-->

## 📌 Topics Covered by Subchapter

### 2.1 Data Manipulation

Learned basic tensor operations using PyTorch’s `torch.tensor` and `torch.arange`. This included indexing, slicing, broadcasting, saving memory through in place operations and conversions of tensors to other Python objects.

<!--### 2.2 Data Preprocessing

Explored data loading with pandas, transforming inputs, and `torch.utils.data.Dataset`. Practiced normalizing and visualizing samples.

### 2.3 Linear Algebra

Got hands-on with dot products, matrix multiplication, identity matrices, and transposes. Wrote helper visualizations using matplotlib.-->

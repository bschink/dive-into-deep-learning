# üìò Chapter 02 ‚Äì Preliminaries

In this chapter I learned or revised the mathematical and programming groundwork essential for deep learning. It revisits key topics such as tensor operations, data preprocessing, linear algebra, calculus, probability, and the use of automatic differentiation ‚Äî all using PyTorch. Each subchapter has its own notebook where I coded along and solved the exercises.

## üìå Topics Covered by Subchapter

### 2.1. Data Manipulation

Learned basic tensor operations using PyTorch‚Äôs `torch.tensor` and `torch.arange`. This included indexing, slicing, broadcasting, saving memory through in place operations and conversions of tensors to other Python objects.

### 2.2. Data Preprocessing

Explored data loading with pandas, data preperation and conversion to the tensor format.

### 2.3. Linear Algebra

Revised linear algebra basics and their Pytorch implementations. This included scalars, vectors, matrices, tensors, reduction, dot product and matrix multiplication.

### 2.4. Calculus

Revised calculus basics and visualization methods. This included derivatives, differentiation, partial derivatives and the chain rule.

### 2.5. Automatic Differentiation

Introduction to the mechanics of the grad() and backward() Pytorch functions as well as detaching.

### 2.6. Probability and Statistics

Revised the basics of probability theory and statistics including random variables, density functions, bayes theorem etc.

### 2.7. Documentation

Tips on how to use the Pytorch documentation.
